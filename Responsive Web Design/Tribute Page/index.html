      <p>This year is what started the real career of Nikola Tesla.<br>
        He worked on several projects, including Tesla Coil, Wireless Lighting, Polyphase System, Steam-powered Oscilating Generator, The Nikola Tesla Company, X-ray Experimentation and Radio Remote Control. He met a lot of people who helped him with these projects.
      </p>
      <h2 id="y-8">1906</h2>
      <p>In this time Nikola Tesla worked with several companies who needed his help. He did made the Bladeless Turbine and the Wireless Lawsuits.</p>

      <p>A science-fiction writer organized a celebration for the 75 birthday of Nikola Tesla. He received a lot of letters for known scientists. Albert Einstein also recognized his work, and he appeared in the cover of Time Magazine.<br>
        Later, he worked with X-ray again and claimed he discovered cosmic rays.
      </p>
      <h2 id="y-10">1943</h2>
